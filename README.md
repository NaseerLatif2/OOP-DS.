OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
A programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which combine data (attributes) and methods (functions). It emphasizes:

Encapsulation: Hiding details inside objects.
Inheritance: Reusing code through parent-child relationships.
Polymorphism: Same method, different behaviors.
Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by hiding details.
Data Structure:
A way of organizing and storing data for efficient access and modification.

Types:

Linear: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue.
Non-Linear: Tree, Graph.
Hash-Based: Hash Table/Map.
Each structure is suited for specific tasks, like searching, sorting, or managing relationships.
